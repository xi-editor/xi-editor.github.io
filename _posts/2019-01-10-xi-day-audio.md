Every few weeks, Raph and I have a catchup call, where we discuss various aspects of xi-editor and related projects. For 2019, we wanted to try something new; recording these conversations and publishing them for the enjoyment of people following along.

Earlier this week, we did our first test episode, which turned out well enough (some audio glitches and breathing noises aside) and so we'd like to share that with you now. Currently you can listen to the [zeroeth episode directly](https://www.cmyr.net/media/xiday/xiday001.mp3), and we'll be getting an RSS feed set up and submitted to Apple's podcast directory soon, so you can listen in your podcast player of choice.
