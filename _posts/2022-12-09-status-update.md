The xi-editor project is currently discontinued. Although we'd like in principle to resume work on it one day, we recognize this is unlikely to occur in the coming years considering the other projects that occupy our time.

You may be interested in [the Lapce editor](https://github.com/lapce/lapce), which
can be considered a spiritual successor to the xi-editor.
